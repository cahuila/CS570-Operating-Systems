Assignment Information: Assignment #2, page replacement 
Filename: readme

File manifest: clock.h, lru.cpp, main.cpp, opt.h, readme, clock.cpp, code.h,
	       lru.h,  opt.cpp, pages.txt, readme, makefile
	       
Compile instructions: type make in directory A2
	       
Design decisions: We decided to code in c++ for this assignment since we coded
                  in c in the first assignment. We implemented opt with array
		  because it is easier to store and look ahead. We implemented 
		  lru with linked list because it is easier to keep the pages in
		  order, so we can remove the least recent used page with ease. 
		  We implemented clock with a circular array so it is easier to 
		  set the use bit, and move the index.
		  
Lesson learned: opt page algorithm, lru algorithm, clock algorithm, teamwork

Program run: 
	Page1: 12 pages
	with framsize 3: OPT has 6 faults
			 LRU has 7 faults
			 clock has 8 faults
			 
	with framsize 5: OPT has 5 faults
	     		 LRU has 5 faults
			 clock has 5 faults
	        
	Page2: 37 pages 
	with framesize 3: OPT has 26 Faults
			  LRU has 34 Faults
			  clock has 34 Faults
			 
	with framesize 5: OPT has 19 Faults
			  LRU has 28 Faults
			  clock has 29 Faults
			  
			  
So our conclusion is the LRU is the closest to the the benchmark OPT. The larger
number of pages decreased the faults seen in LRU.
